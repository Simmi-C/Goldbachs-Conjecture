# Goldbachs Conjecture
A study of Goldbach's conjecture, the sieve of Eratosthenes and Lemoine's conjecture

Goldbach's Conjecture states that "Every even number greater than 4 is the sum of two odd prime numbers". Christian Goldbach composed this idea in 1742, after proposing his idea in a letter to Leonhard Euler, and it remains unproven to this day. To investigate this, I plan to formulate code that will check whether this conjecture holds for the first N even numbers (for a given N).
